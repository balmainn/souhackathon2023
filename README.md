# Submission for Hackathon 2023
## a cocktail "SHAKER" sort...
#### i know the pun is real. 

# Testing:
  ## shakersort: python3 shakersort.py 
  Edit the MAX_ARRAY_SIZE at the top to generate arrays of different sizes
  Edit NUM_ARRAYS_TO_SORT at the top to generate this many arrays. 
  the program will output the input and output arrays as well as whether or not it is sorted. 
  this "should" be more efficient than standard shaker sort which is a bi-directional buble sort. 

## pentameterEncryption
### please input your api key into the file apikey.txt for this to work!
  This program uses wordsapi to get the syllables from an inputted string. the tested string is testString = "In fair Verona where we lay our scene From ancient grudge break to new mutiny Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean"
  To test other strings please edit this variable. 

## isPentameter
  This program simply tests if a string is some multiple of 10 syllables long. Though i ran out of time so its not fully working.
