# You must input the api key into the file apikey.txt for this to work!
# Testing:

  ## shakersort: python3 shakersort.py 
  ## a cocktail "SHAKER" sort...
  #### i know the pun is real. 
  Edit the MAX_ARRAY_SIZE at the top to generate arrays of different sizes </br>
  Edit NUM_ARRAYS_TO_SORT at the top to generate this many arrays. </br>
  the program will output the input and output arrays as well as whether or not it is sorted. </br>
  this "should" be more efficient than standard shaker sort which is a bi-directional bubble sort. 

## pentameterEncryption
  This program "encrypts" an input string, then decrypts it outputing the original, encrypted, and decrypted strings to the user. </br>
  Uses wordsapi to get the syllables from an inputted string.  </br>
  the tested string is </br>
  testString = "In fair Verona where we lay our scene From ancient grudge break to new mutiny Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean"</br>
  To test other strings please edit this variable. However they MUST be a multiple of 10 syllables long, otherwise the program rejects the input.

## isPentameter
  This program simply tests if a string is some multiple of 10 syllables long. its used in pentameter Encryption. </br>
  To test other test strings please edit the testString variable at the top of the file.
