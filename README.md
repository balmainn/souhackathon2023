# Submission for Hackathon 2023
## a cocktail "SHAKER" sort...
#### i know the pun is real. 

# Testing:
  shakersort: python3 shakersort.py 
  Edit the MAX_ARRAY_SIZE at the top to generate arrays of different sizes
  Edit NUM_ARRAYS_TO_SORT at the top to generate this many arrays. 
  the program will output the input and output arrays as well as whether or not it is sorted. 
  this "should" be more efficient than standard shaker sort which is a bi-directional buble sort.
